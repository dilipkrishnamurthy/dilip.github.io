      <br />
  <br />
  <li>
    <b>The Role of Uncertainty Quantification and Propagation in Accelerating the Discovery of Electrochemical Functional Materials.</b> (joint lead author)

    <br> I provided an overview of my work on descriptor selection rules for robust activity and selectivity predictions. 
            <br />
        <br />
  <li>
  <b>Quantifying Robustness of DFT Predicted Pathways and Activity Determining Elementary Steps for Electrochemical Reactions.</b>
  <br>Published in <i>Journal of Chemical Physics</i> (2019).[<a href="https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5056167">link</a>]
  <br> Put forth classification efficiency, a novel metric that quantifies the ability of a descriptor to robustly identify the underlying reaction mechanism (and the associated limiting step).
    <br />
            <br />
  <li>
  <b>Accelerating Energy Materials Discovery and Optimization through Machine Learning based Approaches.</b> (lead author)
  <br>Published in <i>ACS Energy Letters</i> (2018). [<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsenergylett.8b02278">link</a>]
  <br> This viewpoint collates my thoughts and those from leading researchers in the area of machine learning for materials discovery on approaches to accelerate the field. 
    <br />
            <br />
  <li>
  <b>Quantifying Confidence in Density Functional Theory Predicted Surface Pourbaix Diagrams at Solid-Liquid Interfaces and its Implications for Electrochemical Processes.</b>
  <br>Published in <i>Langmuir</i> (2018). [<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.8b02219">link</a>]
  <br>This article adds "confidence level" as a new dimension to Pourbaix diagrams, which are typically used to understand the state of a solid-liquid interface. 
    <br />

  <li>
<b>Quantifying Confidence in DFT Predicted Surface Pourbaix Diagrams and Associated Reaction Pathways for Chlorine Evolution.</b>
<br>Published in <i>ACS Catalysis</i> (2018). [<a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscatal.8b01432">link</a>]
<br> This work i) provides descriptor selection criteria from the standpoint of most robustly predicting reactivity when the intended product can occur through different pathways that all have different reaction intermediates, and ii) identifies the  likely reaction pathway.
