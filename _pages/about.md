I am a Ph.D. candidate in Mechanical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) advised by [Venkat Viswanathan](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/venkatv/index.html). My research interests include computational material design and electrocatalysis in the context of next-generation energy storage and conversion devices. Prior to CMU, I graduated from IIT-Madras in 2015 with a B.Tech. degree in Mechanical Engineering and an M. Tech. degree in Automotive Engineering. A more detailed account can be found in my CV [here](/files/CV_DIlipKrishnamurthy_CMU.pdf). 

I'm a computational materials scientist (with significant previous experimental experience), currently a Manufacturing Futures Initiative Postdoctoral Fellow working in the group of [Venkat Viswanathan](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/venkatv/index.html) on optimization of battery materials. 
Previously, I did my PhD in the [Photovoltaics Research Lab](http://pv.mit.edu) at MIT, where I performed first-principles simulations to understand defect physics in solar cell materials as well as high-throughput device-level simulations to use Bayesian inference along with experimental data to more quickly and accurately measure fundamental materials properties. I developed an open-source code for that project, [bayesim](https://pv-lab.github.io/bayesim/_build/html/index.html), and am always keen to find new users!
My overarching goal in my work is to have an impact on the existential problem of climate change through improving renewable energy technology. I've also been involved in renewables-related outreach through [Project Bright](http://campuspress.yale.edu/projectbright/) at Yale as well as various organizations at MIT including my former research group, the [MIT Energy Club](https://www.mitenergyclub.org) (where I led the Solar/Grid community for two years), the Office of Sustainability, Fossil Free MIT, and the [Science Policy Initiative](mit science policy initative).
Since my time as an undergrad in physics at Yale, I've also been devoted to the cause of increasing representation of women (and other URG's) in STEM fields. In 2012, I helped to organize the Northeast [Conference for Undergraduate Women in Physics](https://www.aps.org/programs/women/workshops/cuwip.cfm), and I returned to the conference as a graduate student speaker 2015. At MIT, I served as co-president of Women of Materials Science (WoMS).
